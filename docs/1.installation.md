You can install this package via composer by running:

```bash
composer require firstpoint-ch/eloquent-translatable
```

Then you can publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="FirstpointCh\\Translatable\\TranslatableServiceProvider"
```

That's it, now you can [configure your model](/eloquent-translatable/2.configuration)
